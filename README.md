## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- ReactJS (used create-react-app command to setup the project)
- SASS Ruby
- React Testing Library


### What I learned
  
1. meta tags are one of the factors that increase SEO and good for accessibility

```html

```

2. 

```html

```

3. 


### Improvements from previous version

1) Instead of getting fonts from another link, I hosted it locally to improve web performance metrics. Th
2) In another iteration, I was able to vertically position the qr code to the center of the mobile screen especially when the bottom bar of the browser exists. In my case, svh unit is suitable since this project does not involve any scrolling
3) Segregated the SCSS files to enhance modularity and maintainability 


### Continued development

1) I would like to implement this project using ReactJS, Sass.
2) Instead of getting fonts from another link, I would like to host it locally to improve web performance metrics like LCP, FCP
3) In another iteration, I would like to explore how to vertically position the qr code to the center especially when the bottom tab exists
4) Segregate the CSS reset in a separate css file (esp handy for larger projects)
