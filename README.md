/* I have spent ard 3h so far to understand npm, node,homebrew, nvm, documentation related to create react app */
/* I have spend 7h 19m +  for writing the react code using create-react-app and for writing sass code, figuring out github 
and how to do live, how to push locally to remote*/


<!--

Continued development:
(DONE) 1) I would like to implement this project using ReactJS, Sass.
(DONE) 2) Instead of getting fonts from another link, I would like to host it locally to improve web performance metrics like LCP, FCP
(DONE) 3) In another iteration, I would like to explore how to vertically position the qr code to the center especially when the bottom tab exists
(DONE) 4) Segregate the CSS reset in a separate css file (esp handy for larger projects)
(DONE) 5) Github
6) Understand the code structure - why !DOCTYPE was necessary, @font-face, progressive web app
(DONE) 7) Investigate why the height is compressed in this version rather than the first - it was because !DOCTYPE was not present before. Without !DOCTYPE -> browser goes to quirk mode (old browsers rendering issue)
8) Improve points from page speed

Why sass is better than css? Does _partials get executed as one css?
Should node_modules be in my github project?
My project not working with GitHub pages but with Netlify - yes
